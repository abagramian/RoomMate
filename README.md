#### Your best mate for planning your future room at RPI!
RoomMate is a web-application project that serves as a utility for RPI students to customize the layout of their dorm room. Users will have the flexibility to collaboratively use a drag and drop functionality to arrange preset furniture items on the canvas. 

### Planned Features
* Preset furniture/room structure items to insert on a canvas
* Preset canvas layouts and furniture itmes specific to RPI dorms.
* Customize canvas size and shape
* A suggestive checklist of items that functions as a checklist for students 
* Changes are visible in realtime
* Open-source, free to use, install on your own hardware


### Current Status of Application
**4/18/2022**  Currently, we have a base project initialized and a home page, ready to be built on. The drag and drop canvas and checklist page are in progress. We have a database planned for future implementation, but current scope will only allow for local storage of 1 canvas.
