#### Your best mate for planning your future room at RPI!
RoomMate is a web-application project that serves as a utility for RPI students to customize the layout of their dorm room. Users will have the flexibility to collaboratively use a drag and drop functionality to arrange preset furniture items on the canvas. 

### Planned Features
* Preset furniture/room structure items to insert on a canvas
* Preset canvas layouts and furniture itmes specific to RPI dorms.
* Customize canvas size and shape
* A suggestive checklist of items that functions as a checklist for students 
* Changes are visible in realtime
* Open-source, free to use, install on your own hardware


### How to Run RoomMate
* Clone repository locally 
* Ensure you have the latest version of `npm`
* Run `npm install` to install required modules
* Run `npm start`


### Current Status of Application
**4/18/2022**  Currently, we have a base project initialized and a home page, ready to be built on. The drag and drop canvas and checklist page are in progress. We have a database planned for future implementation, but current scope will only allow for local storage of 1 canvas. 

**4/21/2022**  We have successfully created a login page (only works with dummy credentials for now), a canvas page, and a checklist page. We are working on linking the pages together using the react-router-dom library. For the canvas component, we're working on adding more customizable features such as resizing the items. We are also in the process of adding the checklist component to our sidebar.
