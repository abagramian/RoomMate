# Style Guidelines
Code should mainly be “self-commenting” in keeping code simple (breaking complex interactions into functions) and then commenting the functions as necessary.
At a minimum, all functions should have comments that give a short description of function usage, parameter details and return details (giving expected types if it’s a dynamic language).
