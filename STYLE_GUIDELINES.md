# Style Guidelines
In order for the project to maintain a concise and consistent code base, this repository will use a coding style that allows easy contribution but is also readable.  
We also employ code reviews during pull requests in order to keep everybody accountable.

Code should be clear, intuitive, and efficient. This means that complex manipulations should be deconstructed into appropriate functions. After, any functions should be commented as necessary.
At a minimum, functions should have comments that give a short description of  usage, parameter details and return details (and expected types if possible).

For the future, we are open to suggestions on specific guidelines per language.
