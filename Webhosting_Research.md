# Website Hosting Research Documentation

## Products
Product: Google Cloud web hosting

Eventually, we would like our product to be public-facing with with a public URL that anyone is able to access.
This is key since our target audience would be incoming students who might not have set up an RPI email yet for two factor.
For the same reason, this is why it would best for us not to host on RPI servers despite the potentially lower costs.
Since we are using Firebase, it might be ideal for us to host the website on Google Cloud since both are Google products.
Out of the web hosting options, I believe the best option would be LAMP stack on Compute Engine.
This is because of its ability to host web applications with dynamic content.
Eventually, our product could contain many methods for customizeability.

## Cost Estimation
According to the website, it should cost around $12.70 per month to host on Google Cloud.
