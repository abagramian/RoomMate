# Database screenshots

These screenshots are taken from the Firebase project created for RoomMate. Each of the collections is based off of the descriptions and models found in [datamodel.md](https://github.com/abagramian/RoomMate/blob/datamodel/datamodel/datamodel.md). All collections have been created with a single "blank" document with all the expected fields.

The user authenication is a feature provided by Firebase. Also included here is a screenshot of the authentication dashboard from the Firebase console. It currently contains information on a single user to demonstrate how this feature will be used. The auto-generated User UIDs from this table are what will be used in any collections that reference a user UID.
