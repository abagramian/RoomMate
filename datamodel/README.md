# RoomMate Data Model

RoomMate will use Firebase to host its database. For more information on the data model, please see [datamodel.md](https://github.com/abagramian/RoomMate/blob/main/datamodel/datamodel.md) as well as [screenshots](https://github.com/abagramian/RoomMate/blob/main/datamodel/screenshots) of the Firebase components.

## How to Link Database?

Since Firebase is a cloud database, an advantage is that we do not have to worry about the on-premises infrastructure.

These are resources on how to link the database:

(4/21/2022 Update) So far, we have created the database in Google Firebase.
Looking to integrate with the frontend.
