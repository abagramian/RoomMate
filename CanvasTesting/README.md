CANVAS TESTING

UPDATE 4/4:
The React DnD library does not provide the capabilities required for this application. Instead, I (Alexis) have been exploring Konva.js and konva-react as an option.

Code in non-react and test-react-app folders are tutorials taken from the resource below in an effort to explore functionalities and capabilities of the library.
