# RoomMate
[Link to repository](https://github.com/abagramian/RoomMate)
## Overview
RoomMate is a web-application that aims to support users in planning the layout of their rooms
in a 2D format. Users will be able to insert preset furniture/room structure items onto a
canvassed layout of a room, with each of these items allowing for custom dimensions. Users will
be able to use drag and drop functionality to arrange items on the canvas. RoomMate will
specifically target RPI students by providing preset dorm room layouts, but users will have the
option to create completely customizable room shapes and sizes.
RoomMate will also provide a “to-get” list of household items that need to be packed/purchased
before the user moves into their new room.
This project will serve both as a utility for RPI students moving into new rooms, as well as an
outlet for the developers to gain experience and understanding of new technologies and
web-based development.
## Semester Plan
In order to achieve a minimum viable product within the allotted time frame for this project, we
will want to include the following in RoomMate:
- Preset furniture/house structure items to insert on a canvas
- The ability to insert the preset furniture/house structure items onto a canvas
- The ability to customize canvas size and shape
- A “to-get” list that functions as a checklist for the user to keep track of household items
that need to be packed or purchased.
- Preset canvas layouts specific to RPI dorms
There are other features that we would like to implement on top of the features listed above, but
will likely not be able to accomplish before the end of the semester. These include:
- Ability to collaborate with other users to build a room layout together and designate items
to members of the group
## Technology
The team currently plans on using the React JavaScript library to develop RoomMate. We are
unsure of what database will be used, but we are looking into MongoDB and SQLite.

## Milestones
Milestones are given as weeks from project start:
- By Week 1: Explore language and database options for tools that best suit the needs of the
application. Also clearly define the application requirements.
- By Week 3: Prepare well-defined wireframes of the application and simple storyboard visuals.
Team should be familiarized with chosen technologies.
- By Week 7: Have a functioning prototype of canvas and preset furniture items and “to-get” list.
- By Week 9: Refine existing features, and have preset canvas layouts functional.
- By Week 10: Minimum viable product should be in a refined and usable state.
